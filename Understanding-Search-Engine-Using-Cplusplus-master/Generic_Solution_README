This is the file where the flow of our code goes after the most relevant search is made
and it pass the control to a mapped Specific Url which is available in "Generic_Solution.txt".
And it opens the URL in the default browser.

# I am using XCode so to Open the Browser we need to import to Frameworks - Core Foundation and ApplicationServices.
# Windows User can use <windows.h> and Shell commands to open the URL in Windows Machine

NOTE: Many URL's provided in the file are dummy and repeated URL's as it has been put in for Testing
